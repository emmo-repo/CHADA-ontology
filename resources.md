# Resources

This document is to keep track of relevant resources for developing taxonomies for the CHAMEO ontology


## Method and Terminology
* [NIST's Materials Data Vocabulary ](https://data.nist.gov/od/id/67C783D4BA814C8EE05324570681708A1899). 3-levels deep taxonomy of characterization techniques.
* IUPAC glossary on [Analytical spectroscopy](https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-REC-19-02-03.R2_PR191002MC.pdf)
* Materials characterisation - Terminology, metadata and 
classification [link here](https://www.cencenelec.eu/media/CEN-CENELEC/CWAs/ICT/cwa17815.pdf)
* EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index useful also for checking term definitions in various ontologies, though mostly life sciences
* List of physical/chemical [properties](http://paulingfile.com/index.php?p=physical%20properties#list%20of%20properties) from the [Pauling file](http://paulingfile.com/index.php?p=home).
* Physical chemistry method ontology [FIX](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/fix) 
* Great tool to explore vocabularies from over [21 ontologies](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies).  
* [Fair sharing](https://fairsharing.org/Chemistry): Existing databases, ontologies and standards for chemistry

## Workflow
* The paper [ESAMP: Event-Sourced Architecture for Materials Provenance management and application to accelerated materials discovery](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c73cbf842e650956db1678) discusses experiment/characterisation workflows and capturing also the state changes in the material/sample itself, and includes implementation case and discussion of the use of Knowledge Graphs.
* The paper [A Perspective on Digital Knowledge Representation in Materials Science and Engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adem.202101176) tackles workflows in Section 6.

## Sample

## Raw Data
* [Ontology](https://github.com/cod-developers/cif_raman) for Raman spectroscopy under developement (inspired by crystallographic cif). Another [Raman database](https://solsa.crystallography.net/rod/1000679.html) using the cif format (can be consider a dictionary).


## Data processing
* [Electronic laboratory notebook](https://www.c6h6.org/) with JavaScript, it has a [data schema](https://cheminfo.github.io/data_schema/) to operate within the ELN. Exchange happens as JCAMP-DX format.
* LIMS Roadmap for materials measurements: https://www.nist.gov/publications/roadmap-lims-nist-material-measurement-laboratory
